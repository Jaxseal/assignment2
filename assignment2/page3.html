                    <h1>Inline</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are three ways which html can acess CSS one 
                        of which is Inline which means that the CSS is written in 
                        the tag of the html elment an example would be &lt;h1 style="color: red; font-size: 30px;"&gt;
                        this will make the text of the h1 element red with a ont size of 30px.The reason
                        why you would use inline css would be is you only want to apply that style to
                        that specific element.
                          
                    </p>
        
                </div>
        </div>

        <div class="colm">
            <h1>Embedded</h1>
            <p> 
                The second way which html can acces html is with embedded css
            this means that the CSS is written at the top of the HTML file
            in the head and it will be in a style tag an example of embedded css would
            be .h1{color: yellow font-size: 50px;} this would make every h1 element in the 
            html file yellow with a font size of 50.the reason why you would use embedded CSS
            over the other two ways is if you want to apply that effect to every h1 element in that
            file but you dont want to apply that effect to all of the files.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="colr">
                <h1>External</h1>
                <p>
                    The third way is external which is written in a seperate file from
            the html file then at the top of the HTML file you reference the css
            file an example of the code which does this is &lt; link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" &gt;
            then in the CSS file is where you write the CSS and then it will apply
            the effect to all the element across all the files it is referenced in 
            also if you use a variable in a CCS file then you have a CSS file refernced below
            the file below will inherit the variables from the file above.
                        
                </p>
    
            </div>
