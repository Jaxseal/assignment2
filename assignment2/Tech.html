                    <p>
                     This means that the webpage will adjust to fit
                     the screen which means that no matter what device you are on
                     you will be able to veiw the website. As you can see this is the code 
                     for it ad what it does is set the elements to be a certain percentage of the screen 
                     which means that the content will be scaled evenly either up or down
                     so that it fits on the screen.

            <h1>Navbars</h1>
            <p> 
                Navbars are normally placed at the top of the page
                to help the user navigate between webpages how you create
                a navbar is by creating a list of items using the ul tag then
                you format the list so that the items are displayed horizontiatlly 
                rather than vertically. Also the items in the lists are links
                to the other webpages so that when you click on then it will take you 
                to the webpage you want to go to.
